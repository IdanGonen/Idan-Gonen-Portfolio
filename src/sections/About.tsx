        I'm 23 years old, live in Holon, Israel. I'm a developer who enjoys
        turning complex problems into clean, efficient solutions. I focus mainly
        on backend development, where I thrive on designing logic, working with
        data, and optimizing performance. I’m always up for a challenge and love
        diving into new technologies, frameworks, and ideas that help me grow as
        a developer.
